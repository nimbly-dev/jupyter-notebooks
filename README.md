This repository is a compilation of all of my Jupyter notebook projects that I have created. Most of these are guided projects on [Dataquest]('dataquest.io/') but with my added flavour and customisation. For easier installation, each notebook project has its own *Dockerfile* so Docker will handle the installation of any required dependencies.
