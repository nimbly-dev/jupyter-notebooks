# Jupyter Notebook Projects Repository

Welcome to my Jupyter Notebook projects repository! This compilation showcases various projects, many of which are guided projects from [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/) but with my unique twists and customizations. Each project comes with its own Dockerfile for seamless installation, thanks to Docker handling the setup of required dependencies.
